# Multilingual and localization

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Beszel!

## Software

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/beszel/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/beszel)

Contributions to improve Beszel's translations are welcome: [crowdin/beszel](https://crowdin.com/project/beszel)

If you want to add a new language, please [post a discussion on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/beszel/discussions) or open an issue on GitHub. I don't always get notified when languages are requested using the native Crowdin functionality.

## Documentation

The repository for this documentation located at https://github.com/henrygd/beszel-docs.

If you want to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

Reference the `zh` directory for the Chinese translations. If you want to add a new language, create a new directory with the language code (`es`, `fr`, etc.).
