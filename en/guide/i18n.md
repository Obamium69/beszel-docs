[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/beszel/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/beszel)

Beszel supports multilingual switching. But currently, only the following languages have been translated:

- English (Native)
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Russian
- Chinese (Simplified)
- Chinese (Traditional)

The following languages are planned but have not yet started translation:

- Arabic
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Ukrainian
- Vietnamese

These translations have not been reviewed by native speakers yet. Contributions to improve Beszel's translations are welcome: [crowdin/beszel](https://crowdin.com/project/beszel)

[Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) might be a temporary solution, and in the future, it may migrate to a completely free platform for open-source projects or self-hosting.
