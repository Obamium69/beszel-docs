# User roles

## Admin

Admins have access to additional links in the hub, such as backups, SMTP settings, etc.

The first user created is automatically set to admin and has a PocketBase superuser account with the same email and password.

> [!TIP] PocketBase superusers are separate from Beszel user roles
> Changing a user's role to admin does not create a PocketBase superuser account. If you want to allow them to access the PocketBase admin panel, you must create a superuser account manually.

## User

Users can create their own systems and alerts. Links to PocketBase settings are not shown in the hub.

## Read only

Read-only users cannot create systems but can view any system shared with them by an admin and create alerts.
